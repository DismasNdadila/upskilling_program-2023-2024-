## Repository Structure:

- This repository contains 8 branches, each corresponding to a week of the program.
- Assignments for each week are stored in their respective branches (e.g., `week_1`, `week_2`, etc.).

## How to Submit Your Assignments:

### Step 1: Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```
### Step 2: Accessing Weekly Branches

To access assignments for a specific week, switch to the corresponding branch:

```

### Step 3: Submitting Assignments

Inside the week's branch, create a folder using your name or unique identifier:

git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```
### Step 5: Pushing Changes

Push your committed changes to the repository:

### Step 6: Creating a Pull Request

Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on "Pull Requests." Create a new pull request from your branch to merge your changes.

### Step 7: Merging Pull Request
